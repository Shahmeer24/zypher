# Zypher

Zypher is a fast, minimal, and temporary file and text sharing app built for real-time convenience. No accounts, no clutter - just drop, share, and forget. Each upload gives you a code and a link to retrieve. Everything auto-deletes after 10 minutes. It can also work as a standalone app (Go to website -> Add to Homescreen)
